Hello WorldðŸ¤©

In my previous articles we have seen that jenkins was manually configured, for example creating jobs, building pipeline and many more. Now in the fast moving world we need to adopt the Devops culture even in this we want things to be automated. So, this article will show you how to make the creating of Jenkins Job automatically using DSL called groovy. So finally we will

âœ” Use groovy to create Jenkins Job automatically

âœ” Deploy it on kubernetes cluster

âœ” Creating deployment.yml file for production environment automatically from testing.yml file for testing environment

Thank you Vimal Daga sir for giving such interesting and industry based use case to solve.
